## Use of waveform timing simulation
We used it both on our own skeleton.v and the provided skeleton_test.v.

For our own skeleton.v, everything worked well.

For skeleton_test.v, address_imem always returned to 0 after reaching 31.

So we posted the result image of skeleton.v instead of the other one.
